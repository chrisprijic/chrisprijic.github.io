As I step into 2022, I want to write down my goals for this year. This list is
by no means all-encompassing but it covers many of the highlights I want to hit
this year.
 
I’ve found writing down and sharing my goals to be a great motivator, so this 
post will hopefully help me be more accountable to my goals this year.
 
## Professional
 
- **The Rust programming language**
 
  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is showing up alot on projects that 
  interest me, and the language's design also draws me in. I've found
  [this experience](https://twitter.com/nodirt_/status/1478419198174896130) of a
  Go developer's journey exploring Rust very insightful as well.
 
- **Real-Time dataata-driven ecosystem**
 
  At Orbee we've started using [Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) to support 
  our real-time data streams and events in late 2021. Moving forward, checking 
  out awesome projects like [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and 
  [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) to build an ecosystem on top of Pulsar is on 
  our list of goals in 2022.
 
## Personal
 
- **Write an article once a month**
 
  To continue to develop my professional writing, I plan on getting myself to 
  write on a regular basis. This is my first post to kick off this trend.
 
  I have some interesting topics in the areas I've worked in (data, analytics,
  marketing and game development) that I want to discuss on this site.
 
- **Read a new book once a month**
 
  To continue to make sure I'm growing and developing personally and
  professionally, I also want to maintain a steady reading habit.
 
  I'm currently reading
  [Modern Software Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-software-engineering/9780137314942/)
  by David Farley to concretize my understanding on how to communicate about
  good software development practices.
 
- **Exercise regularly**
 
  I make sure to get my steps in every day and get my heart rate up *most* days,
  but I want to do better. Working on a more holistic solution so I maintain a
  healthy lifestyle is my goal in 2022.
 
## Projects
 
- **Modified map/reduce project in Rust (Distributed, Cloud-Native)**
 
  I've seen a trend of projects that iterate off of a "modified" Map/Reduce
  software architecture that I find interesting as a solution space; I plan on
  exploring this space with a project of my own.
 
  A great example of this is [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/).
 
- **Create a game in C++**
 
  I've dabbled in game development since College (software rendering,
  Minecraft clone) but never followed through on any of these projects. I've
  also been told finishing that first game is the hardest part -- so I plan on
  starting small and completing a game this year.
 
  [Pong](https://www.ponggame.org/),
  [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), and
  [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) are all great
  examples of games that can be pulled off in a reasonable amount of time.
 
- **Build a personal website** ✅
 
  I purchased this domain a couple years ago. Since then, I haven't used it.
  This year, I've decided to utilize it as a way to accomplish my goals and
  share more of my skills and experiences publicly.
 
I'm excited to see how 2022 goes as I work towards these goals! What are you
planning to accomplish in 2022?

<h1>Personal Goals for 2022</h1>
<div>
<time>January 14, 2022</time>
</div>
</header><p>As I step into 2022, I want to write down my goals for this year. This list is
by no means all-encompassing but it covers many of the highlights I want to hit
this year.</p>
<p>I’ve found writing down and sharing my goals to be a great motivator, so this
post will hopefully help me be more accountable to my goals this year.</p>
<h2 id=professional>Professional</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Rust programming language</strong></p>
<p><a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a> is showing up alot on projects around me,
and the language design also interests me. I&rsquo;ve found
<a href=https://twitter.com/nodirt_/status/1478419198174896130>this experience</a> of a
Go developer&rsquo;s journey exploring Rust very insightful as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-Time dataata-driven ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>At Orbee we&rsquo;ve started using Pulsar to stream our real-time data streams and
events in late 2021. Moving forward, checking out cool projects like
<a href=https://flink.apache.org/>Flink</a> and <a href=https://delta.io/>Delta Lake</a> to
build an ecosystem on top of pulsar is on our list of goals in 2022.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=personal>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Write an article once a month</strong></p>
<p>To work on my professional writing, I plan on getting myself to start writing
on a regular basis. This is my first post to kick off this trend.</p>
<p>I have some interesting topics in the areas I&rsquo;ve worked in (data, analytics,
marketing and game development) that I want to discuss on this site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read a new book once a month</strong></p>
<p>To continue to make sure I&rsquo;m growing and developing personally and
professionally, I also want to maintain a steady reading habit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading
<a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-software-engineering/9780137314942/>Modern Software Engineering</a>
by David Farley to concretize my understanding on how to communicate about
good software development practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise regularly</strong></p>
<p>I make sure to get my steps in every day and get my heart rate up <em>most</em> days,
but I want to do better. Working on a more holistic solution so I maintain a
healthy lifestyle is my goal in 2022.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=projects>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Modified map/reduce project in Rust (Distributed, Cloud-Native)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a trend of projects that iterate off of a &ldquo;modified&rdquo; Map/Reduce
software architecture that I find interesting as a solution space; I plan on
exploring this space with a project of my own.</p>
<p>A great example of this is <a href=https://quickwit.io/>Quickwit</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a game in C++</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dabbled in game development since College (software rendering,
Minecraft clone) but never followed through on any of these projects. I&rsquo;ve
also been told finishing that first game is the hardest part &ndash; so I plan on
starting small and completing a game this year.</p>
<p><a href=https://www.ponggame.org/>Pong</a>,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>Snake</a>, and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders>Space Invaders</a> are all great
examples of games that can be pulled off in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a personal website</strong> ✅</p>
<p>I purchased this domain a couple years ago. Since then, I haven&rsquo;t used it.
This year, I&rsquo;ve decided to utilize it as a way to accomplish my goals and
share more of my skills and experiences publicly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see how 2022 goes as I work towards these goals! What are you
planning to accomplish in 2022?</p>
